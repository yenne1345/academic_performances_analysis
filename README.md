## Introduction
This project delves into the stereotypes surrounding high school students' academic performance in Portuguese language courses. We utilize statistical analysis techniques to investigate how various factors influence students' final grades in these courses.

## Ethical Consideration
Prioritize ethical considerations by ensuring confidentiality and anonymity of student data. Adhere to ethical guidelines in data collection and analysis to protect participants' privacy rights.

## Data Preparation
Clean the dataset to remove inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers to ensure data quality. Prepare the dataset for analysis by transforming and reshaping the data as necessary to facilitate exploration and modeling.

## Data Exploration
Visualize the correlations between different variables using statistical methods such as heatmaps and boxplots to identify potential relationships and patterns.

## Statistical Analysis and Interpretation
Conduct statistical tests, including t-tests and linear regression, to examine the impact of various factors on students' final grades. Interpret the results to identify significant predictors of academic performance and potential risk factors.

## Conclusion
Summarize key findings and insights gained from the analysis, acknowledging limitations and suggesting future research directions.
